# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Buffon-s-Needle
If you were to randomly drop needles onto a plane with parallel lines spaced distance d apart, the ratio of needles that intersect a line to total approaches pi.  Mysterious? I think not.  This is a small project to learn, practice, &amp; share probability theory, specifically Monte Carlo simulations.
