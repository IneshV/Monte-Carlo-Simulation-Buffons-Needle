# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Buffon-s-Needle
If you were to randomly drop needles onto a plane with parallel lines spaced 2 needles apart, the ratio of needles that intersect a line to total approaches pi.  Mysterious? I think not.  This is a small project to learn, practice, & share probability theory, specifically Monte Carlo simulations.

Overview


p_\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\pi}
